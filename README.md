Getting Started:
To get started you will need to include the storefind.js script in your file. However, storefind.js 
uses jquery so you must first have the jquery script tag. You can simply provide the follwing 
script: script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js for jquery. You
may use your own styles. If you would like to use the styles of the table in our example you can use our styles file.
