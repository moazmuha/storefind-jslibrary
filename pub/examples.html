    <h1>Storefind Library</h1>
    <div class = "myround-container">
       <h2>Welcome to The Storefind Library</h2>
       <p>  This library is useful for any business that has many branches. It will allow you to create a
          storefinder tool on your web app or website. This will allow your customers to quickly find the 
          closest branch of your business to them. Your developers can focus on more important aspects of 
          your application and simply use the Storefind JS lbrary to add a "stores near you" page on your 
          website.
       </p>
       <p>
          You simply import the Storefind library. Then use our addStore() function to add the store locations
          you would like to add. The code you will use is "storeFind().addStore("STORE NAME","STORE ADDRESS", "POSTAL CODE")"
          As you can see in the example, in the function you will specify the store or branch name, its address and also 
          its postal code. You can add as many stores as you like. Once you have added all the stores,
          you will use the fucntion addSearchBar(). Here is an example "storeFind().addSearchBar("DIV-ID", "PLACEHOLDER").
          addSearchBar() takes in the div id that you want to display the search bar within on your page and
          the placeholder for the the input feild of the search bar. This is the search bar that your customers 
          will use. They will input their postal code or address and our library will create and display a table with your
          store or branch locations sorted by ascending distnace from the customer. You may use the function 
          storeFind().setDivForTable("DIV-ID") to set the div for where you want the table of locations to be displayed.
          The table will have the columns: store name, location, distance from you, and directions. The directions 
          column will hold a button which links to google maps with the repective stores location. The other columns
          are self explanitory.
       </p>
       <p>
          Below I created an example with the following code: 
       </p>
       <img src="images/code.png" >
       <p>
          You can enter a valid postal code into the search bar below and hit the search button. When you 
          do the home depot locations that were added will be sorted accroding to thier distance from you 
          (the postal code you entered.) All this is done with the few lines of simple code above. The library
          takes care of constructing everything for you. You can do the same thing but with your businesses' locations.

      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
         To get started you will need to include the storefind.js script in your file. However, storefind.js 
         uses jquery so you must first have the jquery script tag. You can simply provide the follwing 
         script: script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js for jquery. You
         may use your own styles. If you would like to use the styles of the table in our example you can use
         our styles file.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions and API</h3>
      <!-- storeFind().addStore("The Home Depot Oakville","2555 Bristol Cir, Oakville, ON", "L6H 5W9")
storeFind().addStore("The Home Depot Milton","1013 Maple Ave, Milton, ON", "L9T 0A5")

storeFind().addSearchBar("#round-container", "Enter Postal Code")

      <p>
         There are only 3 fucntions a user of storeFind library accessess. They are
         <dl>
            <dt>addStore()</dt>
            <dd>This function takes in 3 strings: Store Name, Store Address and Postal Code.
               This function creates store objects which are used in the table when a customer
               searches for stores close to them.
            </dd>
            <dt>addSearchBar()</dt>
            <dd>This function takes in 2 strings. The first is the div id of where you want to place
               the search bar. The 2nd string is the placeholder that you would like for the input feild
               of the search bar. This function creates a search bar and search button. The search button, when
               clicked is set to call sortStores() a private function users don't directly use. The sortStores()
               function sorts the stores that you added using addStore() by ascending distance from the postal 
               code that was inputted into the search bar. sortStores() then calls another private function 
               called createTable() this function actually creates the table of sorted stores with columns
               Name, Location, Distance From You, and Directions. The directions column will hold a button that
               redirects customers to google maps with the address of the location inputted into google maps.
            </dd>
            <dt>setDivForTable()</dt>
            <dd>
               This Function takes in one string. It takes in the div id of where you want to place the table 
               on your page when the search button is clicked. 
            </dd>
          </dl>
      </p>
