    <h1>Storefind Library</h1>
    <div class = "myround-container">
       <h2>Welcome to The Storefind Library</h2>
       <p>  
          This library is useful for any business that has many branches. It will allow you to create a
          storefinder tool on your web app or website. This will allow your customers to quickly find the 
          closest branch of your business to them. Your developers can focus on more important aspects of 
          your application and simply use the Storefind JS lbrary to add a "stores near you" page on your 
          website.
       </p>
       <p>
          You simply import the Storefind library. Then use our addStore() function to add the store locations
          you would like to add. The code you will use is "storeFind().addStore('STORE NAME','STORE ADDRESS', 'POSTAL CODE')"
          As you can see in the example, in the function you will specify the store or branch name, its address and also 
          its postal code. You can add as many stores as you like. Once you have added all the stores,
          you will use the function addSearchBar(). Here is an example, "storeFind().addSearchBar('DIV-ID', 'PLACEHOLDER').
          addSearchBar()" takes in the div id that you want to display the search bar within on your page and
          the placeholder for the input feild of the search bar. This is the search bar that your customers 
          will use. They will input their postal code, address, or city and also 
          the range to search within. Our library will create and display a table with your
          store or branch locations sorted by ascending distance from the customer. You may use the function 
          storeFind().setDivForTable('DIV-ID') to set the div for where you want the table of locations to be displayed.
          The table will have the columns: store name, location, distance from you, and directions. The directions 
          column will hold a button that links to google maps with the repective stores location. The other columns
          are self explanatory.
       </p>
       <p>
          Below I created an example with the following code: 
       </p>
       <img src="images/code.png" >
       <p>
         You can enter a valid postal code into the search bar below and hit the search button. When you 
         do the home depot locations that were added will be sorted according to their distance from you 
         (the postal code you entered.) All this is done with the few lines of simple code above. The library 
         takes care of constructing everything for you. You can do the same thing but with your businesses' locations.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div id= "round-container">
      <h2>Try it out!</h2>
      <p>
         Enter a valid postal code, city, or address and use the slider to select the range to search within. Once you hit the 
         search icon you should see the Home Depot locations sorted in ascending distance from your location. You may go add your
         own locations in examples.js to test the storefinder further. A Google Maps API key is used to find a specified location's 
         latitude and longitude so distance can be calculated. The API key
         that is used in storefind.js is restricted and so you may occasionaly receive a "Not a Valid location" error even when inputting 
         a valid location. This is to stop users
         from spamming. Just retry the same location again and it should work. If you would like you can replace the API key in storefind.js
         with your own. Look for "replace API key below" comments to know where to replace the key with your own.

         instructions on how to get and use Google API keys.

      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
         To get started you will need to include the storefind.js script in your file. However, storefind.js 
         uses jquery so you must first have the jquery script tag. You can simply provide the following script: 
         script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js" for jquery. You may use your 
         own styles. If you would like to use the styles of the table in our example you can use our styles file. 
      </p>
      <h3>Functions and API</h3>
      <p>
         There are only 3 functions a user of storeFind library accessess. They are:
         <dl>
            <dt>addStore()</dt>
               <dd>
                  This function takes in 3 strings: Store Name, Store Address, and Postal Code.
                  This function creates store objects which are used in the table when a customer
                  searches for stores close to them.
               </dd>
            <dt>addSearchBar()</dt>
               <dd>
                  This function takes in 2 strings. The first is the div id of where you want to place the search bar. 
                  The 2nd string is the placeholder that you would like for the input field of the search bar. 
                  This function creates a search bar and search button. The search button, when clicked is set to call 
                  sortStores() private function users don't directly use. The sortStores()
                  function sorts the stores that you added using addStore() by ascending distance from the postal 
                  code that was inputted into the search bar. sortStores() then calls another private function 
                  called createTable() this function actually creates the table of sorted stores with columns
                  Name, Location, Distance From You, and Directions. The directions column will hold a button 
                  that redirects customers to google maps with the address of the location inputted into google maps.
               </dd>
            <dt>setDivForTable()</dt>
               <dd>
                  This Function takes in one string. It takes in the div id of where you want to place the table 
                  on your page when the search button is clicked. 
               </dd>
          </dl>
      </p>
    </div>
