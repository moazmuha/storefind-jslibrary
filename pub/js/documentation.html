       <h2>Welcome to The Storefind Library</h2>
       <p>  This library is useful for any business that has many branches. It will allow you to create a
          storefinder tool on your web app or website. This will allow your customers to quickly find the 
          closest branch of your business to them. Your developers can focus on more important aspects of 
          your application and simply use the Storefind JS lbrary to add a "stores near you" page on your 
          website.
       </p>
       <p>
          You simply import the Storefind library. Then use our addStore() function to add the store locations
          you would like to add. The code you will use is "storeFind().addStore("STORE NAME","STORE ADDRESS", "POSTAL CODE")"
          As you can see in the example, in the function you will specify the store or branch name, its address and also 
          its postal code. You can add as many stores as you like. Once you have added all the stores,
          you will use the fucntion addSearchBar(). Here is an example "storeFind().addSearchBar("DIV-ID", "PLACEHOLDER").
          addSearchBar() takes in the div id that you want to display the search bar within on your page and
          the placeholder for the the input feild of the search bar. This is the search bar that your customers 
          will use. They will input their postal code or address and our library will create and display a table with your
          store or branch locations sorted by ascending distnace from the customer. You may use the function 
          storeFind().setDivForTable("DIV-ID") to set the div for where you want the table of locations to be displayed.
          The table will have the columns: store name, location, distance from you, and directions. The directions 
          column will hold a button which links to google maps with the repective stores location. The other columns
          are self explanitory.
       </p>
       <p>
          Below I created an example with the following code: 
       </p>
       <img src="images/code.png" >
       <p>
          Youl this is done with the few lines of simple code above. The library
          takes care of constructing everything for you. You can do the same thing but with your businesses' locations.
